# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including technology choices, infrastructure, and deployment strategy. It outlines how different components interact and how the platform is structured to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

> **This document serves as a reference for the development team, ensuring alignment in technology choices and deployment strategies. It is a living documentation and must be adjusted/updated on each iteration.**

## **1. System Overview**

The white-label video course platform follows a **modular monolith** architecture, ensuring clear module separation while maintaining simplicity in development and deployment. The backend is built using **HyperF (PHP)**, running in a **Dockerized** environment with **MySQL** as the relational database. The frontend is developed using **Nuxt** and deployed on cloud services.

| Component             | Technology/Provider                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**           | HyperF (PHP)                                                          |
| **Frontend**          | Nuxt (Vue.js)                                                         |
| **Containerization**  | Docker (Swarm if required)                                            |
| **Hosting (Backend)** | Hostinger VPC                                                         |
| **Database**          | MySQL                                                                 |
| **Frontend Hosting**  | Firebase Hosting (Client-side) **or** Cloudflare Workers (SSR Option) |
| **Image Storage**     | Google Cloud Storage                                                  |
| **Video Hosting**     | YouTube (Free Courses), Vimeo (Paid Courses)                          |
| **Logging System**    | To be determined                                                      |
## **3. Backend Architecture**

### **3.1 Framework and Language**
- **Backend Framework:** HyperF (PHP)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Modular Monolith / Clean Architecture
- **Containerisation:** Docker (Swarm when needed)
- **Hosting Provider:** Hostinger VPC
- **Database:** MySQL

### **3.2 Key Design Principles**
- **Modular Structure:** The backend is structured as a modular monolith, allowing for future refactoring into micro-services if needed.
- **High Decoupling:** The architecture follow Clean principles to ensure high decoupling while the Business logic follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure separation of concerns and the use of the ubiquitous language in the code.

### **3.3 Infrastructure**
- Backend and database run inside **Docker** containers.
- Containers are deployed on a **Hostinger VPC**.
- **Docker Swarm** will be introduced as an orchestration tool when scaling is required.
- A **relational database (MySQL)** is used to ensure data integrity.

---

## **4. Frontend Architecture**

### **4.1 Framework and Language**
- **Frontend Framework:** Nuxt (Vue.js)
- **Deployment Options:**  
  - **Firebase Hosting** (for client-side rendering).  
  - (OR) **Cloudflare Workers** (for potential SSR deployment).  

### **4.2 Key Features**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support:** Allows for improved SEO.
- **Static Generation (SSG) Support:** Ensures fast delivery for pre-rendered content.
- **Modular Components:** Components are built to be reusable across different tenants.

---

## **5. Media and Storage Strategy**

### **5.1 Image Storage**
- **Service:** Google Cloud Storage.
- **Reasoning:** Provides cost-effective, scalable, and reliable storage.

### **5.2 Video Hosting**
- **Free Courses:** Hosted on **YouTube**.
- **Paid Courses:** Hosted on **Vimeo** for more control over access.

### **5.3 Logging Strategy**
- Logs will be stored in a **cost-effective database** designed for large-scale log storage.
- The exact database choice will be determined later based on performance and cost considerations.

---

## **6. Deployment Strategy**

### **6.1 Backend Deployment**
- **Containerisation:** Dockerized backend running on Hostinger VPC.
- **Scaling:** Docker Swarm will be introduced if required for load balancing.
- **Database Management:** MySQL is managed in a separate Docker container.

### **6.2 Frontend Deployment**
- **Firebase Hosting** (Initial client-side deployment).
- **Cloudflare Workers** (Potential server-side rendering option).

### **6.3 Video and Image Hosting**
- Images stored in **Google Cloud Storage**.
- Videos initially stored in **YouTube**, later moved to **Vimeo** for paid courses.

---

## **7. Future Considerations**
- **Scalability:** Migration to micro-services if needed.
- **Logging System:** Selecting an optimised database for large-scale logging. **!Important**
- **Advanced Video Handling:** Exploring self-hosted video solutions in the future.
