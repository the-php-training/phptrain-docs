# Domain Model

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the domain concepts, their interactions, and how they are modelled in the system. It serves as a foundational guide for designing the platform according to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

> **It is a living documentation and must be adjusted/updated on each iteration.**

---

## **1. Overview**

The white-label video course platform follows a multi-tenant architecture where each **Teacher** operates independently with their own **Courses** and **Students**. The core domain revolves around managing courses, structuring content, tracking student interactions, and issuing certificates.

---

## **2. Aggregate Roots and Entities**

### **Tenant (Aggregate Root)**
- Represents an independent Teacher and their learning environment.
- Owns the lifecycle of **Courses** and **Students** within their platform.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID) – Unique identifier for the Tenant.
- `name` (String) – Tenant's name (e.g., "John Doe Academy").
- `email` (String) – Contact email.
- `createdAt` (DateTime) – Date of account creation.

#### **Relationships:**
- Has many **Courses**.
- Manages many **Students**.

---

### **Course (Aggregate Root)**
- A structured collection of learning materials created by a Teacher.
- Defines Subjects and Topics to organize learning.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID) – Unique identifier.
- `title` (String) – Course name.
- `description` (Text) – Overview of the Course.
- `tenantId` (UUID) – Reference to the Tenant (Teacher).
- `createdAt` (DateTime).

#### **Relationships:**
- Has many **Topics**.
- Can be enrolled in by many **Students**.

---

### **Topic (Entity)**
- A single learning unit within a Course.
- Can have dependencies on other Topics.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `title` (String).
- `courseId` (UUID) – Reference to the Course.
- `dependencyIds` (List of UUIDs) – Other Topics that must be studied first.

#### **Relationships:**
- Can contain multiple **Content** elements.

---

### **Content (Entity)**
- Represents the actual learning material within a Topic.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `topicId` (UUID) – Reference to the Topic.
- `type` (Enum: Text, Video, Activity, Knowledge Assessment).
- `data` (JSON) – Stores details specific to each content type.

#### **Relationships:**
- Belongs to a **Topic**.
- Generates **Interaction** records when accessed by a Student.

---

### **Student (Aggregate Root)**
- A user who enrolls in a Teacher’s Course.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `tenantId` (UUID) – Reference to the Tenant (Teacher).
- `email` (String).
- `createdAt` (DateTime).

#### **Relationships:**
- Can enroll in multiple **Courses**.
- Generates **Interaction** records.

---

### **Enrollment (Entity)**
- Links a **Student** to a **Course**.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `studentId` (UUID).
- `courseId` (UUID).
- `enrolledAt` (DateTime).

#### **Relationships:**
- Connects **Students** with **Courses**.

---

### **Interaction (Entity)**
- Tracks Student engagement with Course Content.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `studentId` (UUID).
- `contentId` (UUID).
- `interactionType` (Enum: View, Complete, Submit, Score).
- `timestamp` (DateTime).
- `metadata` (JSON) – Additional details (e.g., video watch time, quiz score).

#### **Relationships:**
- Belongs to a **Student** and **Content**.

---

### **Certificate (Entity)**
- Represents a proof of course completion.

#### **Attributes:**
- `id` (UUID).
- `studentId` (UUID).
- `courseId` (UUID).
- `status` (Enum: Pending, Issued).
- `issuedAt` (DateTime, nullable).
- `documentPath` (String, nullable) – Path to uploaded certificate.

#### **Relationships:**
- Requested by a **Student**.
- Issued manually by a **Teacher**.

---

## **3. Key Business Rules**
- A **Course** must have at least one **Topic** before it can be published.
- A **Topic** can be linked to multiple prerequisite **Topics** using dependencies.
- A **Student** can access all Course Content immediately upon enrollment.
- **Interactions** are logged automatically when Students engage with Content.
- A **Certificate** request is only available once the Student fulfills the Course requirements.

---

## **4. Future Enhancements**
While the MVP focuses on manual certificate issuance and simple tracking, future iterations may include:
- Automated course progression tracking.
- More detailed analytics and reporting.
- Certification criteria customization.
