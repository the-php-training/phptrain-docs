# Ubiquitous Language

This document defines the common terminology used across the white-label video course platform. By establishing a shared language, we ensure that all stakeholders, including developers, teachers, and students, have a clear and consistent understanding of the platform’s concepts.

> **It is a living documentation and must be adjusted/updated on each iteration.**

## Purpose of This Language

By standardizing these terms, we create a common foundation that aligns business discussions, development efforts, and user interactions. This ensures clarity in design, implementation, and communication across the platform.

## Core Concepts

### Tenant
A **Tenant** represents an independent teacher who owns and manages their own platform instance. Each Tenant operates in isolation from others, with their own Courses, Students, and Branding.

### Teacher
A **Teacher** is a user who creates and manages Courses within their Tenant. Teachers are responsible for defining the Course structure, adding Content, and managing Student Enrollments.

### Student
A **Student** is a user who enrolls in Courses offered by a Teacher. Students can access Course Content, interact with different learning materials, and request Certificates upon course completion.

### Course
A **Course** is a structured collection of Topics created by a Teacher. It provides the learning path for Students and contains all related Content.

### Topic
A **Topic** is a specific unit of learning within a Course. It represents a focused section of Content that a Student can engage with.

### Topic Dependency
A **Topic Dependency** is a relationship between Topics that defines a recommended learning sequence. If a Topic has a Dependency, a Student is advised to complete the prerequisite Topic before engaging with the dependent Topic.

### Content
**Content** refers to the learning materials within a Topic. A Topic can contain multiple types of Content, such as:
- **Text**: Written instructional material.
- **Video**: Pre-recorded lessons or explanations.
- **Activity**: Exercises or assignments for hands-on learning.
- **Knowledge Assess**: A set of questions to assess the Student’s understanding of the Topic.

### Enrollment
**Enrollment** is the process by which a Student registers for a Course. Once enrolled, the Student gains access to all Topics and Content within the Course.

### Interaction
An **Interaction** is any recorded activity between a Student and a piece of Content. Different types of Content generate different Interaction data, such as:
- Viewing time for videos.
- Completion status for activities.
- Scores for knowledge assessment.

### Certificate
A **Certificate** is a document issued by a Teacher to confirm a Student’s completion of a Course. In the MVP, Students can request a Certificate once they fulfil the Course's requirements, and Teachers manually issue and upload the document.

### Discord Server
The **Discord Server** is an external communication platform where Students and Teachers interact. All discussions, Q&A, and engagement outside the learning content occur within the Teacher’s dedicated Discord community.
